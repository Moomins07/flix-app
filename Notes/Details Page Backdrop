The API includes 'movie backdrop', which we can use to make the site look a little more professional.
We will be using the backdrop on both our movie details and tv details page.
We first create a function called displayBackgroundImage with 2 parameters (type and backgroundPath)
displayBackgroundImage(type, backgroundPath)

Inside of this function I created a div.
I then use style.backgroundImage to target a specific url with the id.
overlayDiv.style.backgroundImage = `url(https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/${backgroundPath})`;
Followed by a lot of CSS styling inside of the function, which I'm not too sure if I'm happy with. I personally feel like it may have been better to store these styles in a class within our stylesheet, especially as there is so many of them.

Lastly, an if statement that checks whether it is tv details or movie details.

if (type === 'movie') {
document.querySelector('#movie-details').appendChild(overlayDiv);
} else document.querySelector('#show-details').appendChild(overlayDiv);

By calling this function inside of our displayMovieDetails() function, our backdrop is added!
