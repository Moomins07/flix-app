In this lecture, we're actually using the API and displaying the top 20 popular movies on the front page of the website.

Whilst a little complex and completely new to me, this was extremely fun to do, as I can only imagine just how much has opened up to me now that I can retrieve data from an API.

We first created a function 'fetchAPIData' that we can use to fetch data from the API which sends off our API key every time we use it as it's required. The API url is stored in a variable, which we combine with the endpoint URL (E.g. movies/popular) to fetch the required data.

Now we create a function that will display the popular movies. Using destructuring, we pull 'results' from the returned API data that we retrieved using the 'fetchAPIData' function.

Now that we've captured that data, we loop over it using forEach and create a div with the class of 'card' so that the CSS is applied. The div.innerHTML is set to the original HTML used to create the 'original' cards where we now use template literals to add the relevant dat from the API. We then append those cards to the parent element #popular_movies.

As a fun side project, I tried to reduce the cards from 20 to 4, but found that the API always returns 20 no matter what. After some research, the only way to do this would be to use the slice() method. I stored results.slice(0,4) into a variable and looped through that instead, thus only displaying 4 movies on screen!

I'm really looking forward to the next lecture.
