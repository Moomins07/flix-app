This lesson was really cool and something I've wanted to do for a long time, which is to use a library to create some animated site effects.

After following this lecture, there's a a 'Now Playing' section at the top of the site that scrolls through movies that are currently playing in Cinemas. It is also mobile responsive and customiseable!

The code itself was not particularly difficult to follow as it's followed somewhat of the same general process as previous functions.

First we create the function displaySlider(), which is placed with our index.html section in our page-routing. We async await using our fetchAPIData() function from 'movie/now_playing'. 

We destructure and 'pull' the 'results' from that data followed by looping through that data and once again creating a div for each movie. We add a class of 'slider-swipe' to each div created and then set the innerHTML of the created divs as follows:


            `<a href="movie-details.html?id=${movie.id}">
              <img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500${movie.poster_path}" alt="${movie.title}" />
            </a>
            <h4 class="swiper-rating">
              <i class="fas fa-star text-secondary"></i> ${movie.vote_average} / 10
            </h4>`;

We make sure they are clickable links by using anchor tags and movie.id. We use poster_path again for the images, followed by the rating of the movie and appending the div to the parent container of .swiper-wrapper.

It's important to note that the swiper animation requires a little more setting up, so we also invoke the function of 'initSwiper()' within the forEach loop so that it is called everytime a div is created.

The initSwiper function is mostly just configuration as you can see below: 

function initSwiper() {
  const swiper = new Swiper('.swiper', {
    slidesPerView: 1,
    spaceBetween: 30,
    freeMode: true,
    loop: true,
    autoplay: {
      delay: 4000,
      disableOnInteraction: false,
    },
    breakpoints: {
      500: {
        slidesPerView: 2,
      },
      700: {
        slidesPerView: 3,
      },
      1200: {
        slidesPerView: 4,
      },
    },
  });
}

Definitely using this again!
