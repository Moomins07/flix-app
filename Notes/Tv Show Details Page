This was obviously once again very similar to our movie details page. I removed the hard-coded values from the HTML and copied our displayMovieDetails function and changed the template literals as needed to produce the data on the site.

No real issues to report, except for the lack of mobile responsiveness in the site as flexbox/grid was not properly being utilised on the details pages. I somewhat fixed this but I can appreciate that this project is obviously for JavaScript purposes, not necessarily making the website look 'perfect'.

Some of the data property names change when using TV shows data, rather than the movie data, so I naturally found that a lot of the code wasn't necessarily returning the data when I simply changed our data variable from movie > show. Thankfully my lecturer is already aware of this and knows the correct API data property names, but obviously if this were not the case, I would have to console.log and check the returned data myself or refer to the API reference guide.
